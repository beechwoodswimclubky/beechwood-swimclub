      <p style="color: #fff;">For people seeking for Beechwood Swim Club membership, we have started a new email address specifically related to our waitlist and membership inquiries. 
      It is: <a style="color: #fff;" href="mailto:waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com">waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p style="color: #fff;">If you have already inquired in the past, you do *not* have send one to the new address. The waitlist / bond / rental inquiries 
      were simply overwhelming our club email address, so we needed to separate them out. </p>
