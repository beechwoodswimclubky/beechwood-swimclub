### We are the Beechwood Barracudas!

The Beechwood Barracudas are a summer recreational swim and dive team that is a member of the Northern Kentucky Swim League.  The season begins in early June and typically ends in late July.  Practices are held Monday through Thursday mornings.  Diving meets are on Tuesday evenings and Swimming meets are on Thursday evenings.

The main goal of the Beechwood Barracudas is to provide a fun environment where the children can make new friends while becoming stronger swimmers and graceful divers.  All skill levels are welcome.  To be on the swim team, your child should be able to swim 1 length of the pool freestyle and 1 length backstroke.  If a swimmer cannot swim the length of the pool, they can start with the Little Cudas, which will work on teaching the fundamentals of competitive swimming and building up endurance.
